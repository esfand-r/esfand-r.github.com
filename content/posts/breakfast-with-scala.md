Every now and then a beautiful new language emerges and dies quickly lacking marketing and backing of the giants. While it’s very, very sad, learning a new language is not about the next “ big thing". It's about thinking in different ways outside of normal thought patterns.

This talk was organized not only in an attempt to discuss the importance of this challenge with colleagues, but also to introduce a fairly new jvm language and a paradigm quite different from imperative programming.

There is an inherent beauty in a polyglot world.  It leads to chaos. Tame it and it will breathe creativity!

“if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow” -St-Exupéry, The Little Prince
